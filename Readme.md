# Algorithms and Data Structures Projects

## Project 1
Created a schedule manager based on given data in C++. Allowed development of skills in parsing documents, object-oriented principles, creating appropriate data structures based on data, and algorithms for lookup, alteration and visualization of these data structures.

## Project 2
Created an airline management system, based on given data in C++. Same as Project1, but algorithms were more complex, we had to do more than lookup stuff and store it well and alter it well, we had to create algorithms to give out results based on the data, like essential airports that help connect other airports, minimal flight routes using intermediate airports, busiest airports, best flight option based on origin and destination, among others.

Done by Bruno Moreira, João Proença and Rodrigo Resende.
